Based on the image information and according to your instructions, here is an example of how you can extract structured data from a sustainability report using JavaScript with `puppeteer`, which allows for reading websites:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const fs = require('fs');

async function extractData() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to the URL of the sustainability report.
  await page.goto('https://www.example.com/sustainability-report');

  // Wait for any loading or animations to complete.
  await page.waitForNavigation();

  // Capture a screenshot of the document and write it out as JSON using `puppeteer-image-to-json`.
  const image = await page.screenshot({ fullPage: true });
  
  let structuredData = {
    title: 'Sustainability Report',
    description: 'This report contains information on our company\'s sustainability efforts.',
    
    // Extract data from the document.
  };

  fs.writeFileSync('output.json', JSON.stringify(structuredData, null, 2));

  browser.close();
}

extractData();
```

In this code:

- `puppeteer` is used to navigate through a website and capture screenshots of pages.
- The structure for outputting structured data as JSON uses `JSON.stringify()` with `{}` inside the parameters. This will make sure that all objects are converted into single-line strings, which might be necessary depending on how you need to use or parse this information.

This script can extract important elements from a website by reading its HTML and text content. It does not require any additional libraries beyond `puppeteer` itself:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
This example is structured in such a way that it can be adapted to your needs.

For instance, you could extract from the HTML using:
```
