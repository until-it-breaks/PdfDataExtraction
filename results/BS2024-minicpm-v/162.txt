Explanation:

1. The data is extracted from the relevant sections of the image.
2. Each section (such as attendance for different years) and sub-sections (like museums, services provided by SMA) are structured in an appropriate JSON format following snake_case syntax without spaces or accents.
3. Relevant numeric values such as museum attendances were formatted to reflect their original numerical structure with decimals when necessary.
4. Since the image contains tables, graphs, infographics, and performance indicators along with specific visual data representations like percentages, these are included in the structured output.

This JSON output is organized hierarchically where appropriate (such as nested arrays for services provided by SMA), ensuring a clear and accessible structure that can be easily read or used programmatically.
