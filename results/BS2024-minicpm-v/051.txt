Based on the provided image and following all criteria for extracting relevant structured data points to evaluate a company's sustainability performance, here is an example of how such information could be organized in JSON format:

```json

{

  "title": "Educazione e comunicazione studentesca",

  "innovationidatticata": {

    "European Higher Education Quality Assurance (ESG)": {

      "number_of_achievements": 2013,

      "percentage_of_students": {"graduation":"4.947", "diploma":"4.156},

      "overall_trend": ["Increase in Graduation Rates", "Decrease in Diploma Issuance"]

    },

    "Lauree e condizione occasionale":

    {

      "total_laurees": 2013,

      "national_sixthormonth": {"2023":"4.947", "2022":"4.156", "2021":"2.895"},

      "overall_trend": ["Increase in Number of Laurees"]

    }

  },

  "educationalcenter": {

    "Teaching_and_Learning_Center": {

      "percentage_of_students_who_complete_courses": {"70%"},

      "top_institution": "Campus_Bologna"

    }

  },

  "tempisque_dei_conseguent": {

    "tempisque": {

      "percentage": ["69.9%", "18.3%"],

      "units_of_tempisque": "2023", 

      "first_year": ["71.9%", "2022"],  

      "second_year_or_more": ["75.4%", "2023"]

    }

  },

}

```

This JSON structure organizes the information into key categories, such as Innovation and Atticata (Education), Lauree e condizione occasionale (Degrees and Temporary Positions), Teaching_and_Learning_Center, and Tempisque_dei_conseguent.

The keys are named in snake case to follow common conventions for JSON objects. This example includes the percentage of students who complete their courses within a year from each institution, as well as other educational performance metrics such as graduation rates, diploma issuance, number of laurees (degrees), and temporary positions held by individuals after completing an education.

Note that this representation is hypothetical because real-world data typically contains much more specific information.
